                    <span style="font-style: italic">Saccharomyces cerevisia</span> e is a GRAS (generally regarded as
                    safe) microorganism. It has a clear
                    genetic background, and is commonly applied in simple genetic operations. It has been widely
                    employed as the chassis organism for the biosynthesis of natural products in food, medicine, and
                    other fields. In this work, we tried to construct the ergothioneine metabolic pathway in
                    <span style="font-style: italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span> CEN.PK113-5D. Two genes, NcEgt1 and
                    CpEgt2, were integrated into genome by
                    homologous recombination mediated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The strain we used in the project for
                    cloning unmethylated DNA is <span style="font-style: italic">E. coli</span> JM110. It is a commonly
                    used strain, whose safety has been
                    verified, and only requires laboratory safety level P1. There is no risk to our community and the
                    environment.

                    Our main goal is to achieve higher production of ergothioneine, which is a natural antioxidant. As
                    an important active substance in the body, it is distributed in some tissues and organs of mammals.
                    It can be safely used in new food supplements in the diet of infants, young children, and women who
                    are pregnant or lactating.
